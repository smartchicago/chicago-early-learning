"Mayor Emanuel and the City of Chicago have made a firm commitment to "

"children, including early education seats where they are most needed. One of "
"the most important pieces is ensuring that parents have access to the "
"information they need to make the choices that are best for their children, "
"and the Early Learning Portal is a piece of that objective. Here, parents "
"will find a list of all of the early learning programs that receive City "
"funding, an easy-to-use interactive map, basic information about the "
"programs available at every site and suggested questions they should ask any "
"early learning site provider in order to determine if that location is right "

"Mayor Emanuel and the City of Chicago have made a firm commitment to "

"the most important pieces is ensuring that parents have access to the "
"information they need to make the choices that are best for their children, "

"will find a list of all of the early learning programs that receive City "
"funding, an easy-to-use interactive map, basic information about the "
"programs available at every site and suggested questions they should ask any "

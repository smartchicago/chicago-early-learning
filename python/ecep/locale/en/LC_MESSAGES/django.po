"The newly re-opened Thomas Hughes Children’s Library, powered by Exelon, was "
"dedicated by Mayor Emanuel on July 13th. The re-envisioned space boasts a "
"maker space and distinct areas or “neighborhoods” for early learners: ages "
"0-5, middle-childhood learners: 6-10 and tweens: ages 11-14 with a full "
"digital media lab. Additionally, there is a common area for learning through "
"sharing, called the Plaza, programming rooms, a Quiet Suite with a family "
"washroom, a mother’s room and a quiet sitting area, and areas for STEM "
"programming, story hours and conferences."

"With the space comes re-envisioned programming that embeds STEM/STEAM "

"Rahm’s Readers Summer Learning Challenge. As a part of this funding, Exelon "
"has also provided funds to re-imagine additional branches early learning "
"spaces and provide curated collections of toys and early STEM for families "

"Support Services, the Smart Chicago Collaborative, and the University of "
"Chicago Urban Education Lab.</p>\n"
"\n"
"    <p>Mayor Rahm Emanuel has made investment in early childhood education a "
"cornerstone of his administration, with the goal of serving at-risk children "
"and increasing the transparency and accountability of city programs.</p>\n"
"\n"
"    <p>Announcing this initiative in September 2011, the Mayor remarked: “We "
"must provide children in every neighborhood with the tools they need to "
"excel in school and succeed in the workforce, and that includes providing "
"excellent early childhood education . . . these reforms will help parents "
"find opportunities for their children and better prepare our students for "
"the rigors of elementary, middle and high school classrooms.”</p>\n"

"    <p>Mayor Emanuel and the City of Chicago have made a firm commitment to "
"providing children across the city with access to high-quality education, "
"from early learning programs all the way up through college. That is why the "
"Mayor’s 2013 budget includes an incredible investment in programming for "
"children, including early education seats where they are most needed. One of "
"the most important pieces is ensuring that parents have access to the "
"information they need to make the choices that are best for their children, "
"and the Early Learning Portal is a piece of that objective. Here, parents "
"will find a list of all of the early learning programs that receive City "
"funding, an easy-to-use interactive map, basic information about the "
"programs available at every site and suggested questions they should ask any "
"early learning site provider in order to determine if that location is right "

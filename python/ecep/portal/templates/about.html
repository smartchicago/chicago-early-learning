    {% blocktrans %}
    <p>The Chicago Early Learning Portal is a collaboration between the City of Chicago, the Chicago Public Schools, the Chicago Department of Family and Support Services, the Smart Chicago Collaborative, and the University of Chicago Urban Education Lab.</p>

    <p>Mayor Rahm Emanuel has made investment in early childhood education a cornerstone of his administration, with the goal of serving at-risk children and increasing the transparency and accountability of city programs.</p>

    <p>Announcing this initiative in September 2011, the Mayor remarked: “We must provide children in every neighborhood with the tools they need to excel in school and succeed in the workforce, and that includes providing excellent early childhood education . . . these reforms will help parents find opportunities for their children and better prepare our students for the rigors of elementary, middle and high school classrooms.”</p>

    <p>For technical assistance or for more information about the Early Learning Portal, please contact <a href="mailto:info@chicagoearlylearning.org">info@chicagoearlylearning.org</a>.</p>

    <p>For general questions about early learning options in Chicago, including information about enrollment, eligibility, and payment, please refer to our FAQ page.</p>

    <p>Mayor Emanuel and the City of Chicago have made a firm commitment to providing children across the city with access to high-quality education, from early learning programs all the way up through college. That is why the Mayor’s 2013 budget includes an incredible investment in programming for children, including early education seats where they are most needed. One of the most important pieces is ensuring that parents have access to the information they need to make the choices that are best for their children, and the Early Learning Portal is a piece of that objective. Here, parents will find a list of all of the early learning programs that receive City funding, an easy-to-use interactive map, basic information about the programs available at every site and suggested questions they should ask any early learning site provider in order to determine if that location is right for their child.</p>

    <h1 class="static-title">About the Chicago Early Learning Portal</h1>
    <p>The Chicago Early Learning Portal is a collaboration between the City of Chicago, the Chicago Public Schools, the Chicago Department of Family and Support Services, the Smart Chicago Collaborative, and the University of Chicago Urban Education Lab.</p>

    <p>Mayor Rahm Emanuel has made investment in early childhood education a cornerstone of his administration, with the goal of serving at-risk children and increasing the transparency and accountability of city programs.</p>

    <p>Announcing this initiative in September 2011, the Mayor remarked: “We must provide children in every neighborhood with the tools they need to excel in school and succeed in the workforce, and that includes providing excellent early childhood education . . . these reforms will help parents find opportunities for their children and better prepare our students for the rigors of elementary, middle and high school classrooms.”</p>

    <p>For technical assistance or for more information about the Early Learning Portal, please contact <a href="mailto:info@chicagoearlylearning.org">info@chicagoearlylearning.org</a>.</p>

    <p>For general questions about early learning options in Chicago, including information about enrollment, eligibility, and payment, please refer to our FAQ page.</p>

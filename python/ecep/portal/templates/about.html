        <p>{% blocktrans %}Mayor Emanuel and the City of Chicago have made a firm commitment to providing children across the city with access to high-quality education, from early learning programs all the way up through college. That is why the Mayor’s 2013 budget includes an incredible investment in programming for children, including early education seats where they are most needed. One of the most important pieces is ensuring that parents have access to the information they need to make the choices that are best for their children, and the Early Learning Portal is a piece of that objective. Here, parents will find a list of all of the early learning programs that receive City funding, an easy-to-use interactive map, basic information about the programs available at every site and suggested questions they should ask any early learning site provider in order to determine if that location is right for their child.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

    <h2 class="question">Will I have to pay anything to enroll my child?</h2>

    <p>The best way to find out whether you will have to pay anything is to call the center or program and ask.  Some locations receive funding from the government so that families who cannot afford to pay can still benefit from early learning programs.  Other programs accept child care assistance payments (CCAP) or base the amount your family owes on your income.  Many programs have a combination of funding sources. Because every family and program is different, it is very important to call the programs you are interested in to talk about payment options.</p>

    <h2 class="question">How do I enroll my child?</h2>

    <p>While there are certain broad eligibility requirements for different program types (such as age limits), many programs also have specific rules about who can apply and attend.  The process for applying may also be different across programs.  The best way to figure out whether your child is eligible for a certain program is to call and talk to program staff.</p>

    <h2 class="question">Why is there a wait list?</h2>

    <p>A wait list is part of the application process in the majority of programs. Usually a family is added to the wait list while going through the application process and determining funding eligibility. A family may also be added to the wait list if no spots are available in the program. You can contact programs at any time during the year to find out about their specific wait list procedures.</p> 

    <h2 class="question">What questions should I ask the program staff?</h2>

    <p>It is a good idea to write down a list of questions before calling a program.  Here are a few suggestions of things to ask, in addition to your own specific questions:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Will I have to pay anything?</li>
    <li>What are the eligibility criteria for this program?</li>
    <li>How do I apply to enroll my child?</li>
    <li>What are the hours for pick-up and drop-off?</li>
    <li>What kind of information or documents will you need for my child (birth certificate, immunization records, etc.)?</li>
    <li>Will my child need a physical exam before enrolling?</li>
    <li>Is there a wait list for this program?  How long is it?</li>
    <li>Are there any additional fees I should know about?</li>
    <li>Are there requirements for parent/family involvement?  What are they?</li>
    <li>Do I have to have a job in order to send my child to this program?</li>
    <li>What are the attendance policies?</li>
    <li>How often do children have off because of professional development for teachers?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="question">What does “accreditation” mean?</h2>

    <p>Accreditation means that a program has met very high standards of excellence determined by a national organization such as the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), National Early Childhood Program Accreditation (NEPCA), or the Council on Accreditation (COA).  Programs that receive national accreditation have demonstrated that they provide the highest quality in areas such as teaching, curriculum, learning assessments, health, community relationships, physical environment, and management.</p>

    <h2 class="question">What do the stars mean next to the program names?  Why are they blank?</h2>

    <p>Over the next few months, every early learning program in Chicago will have the option to receive a rating out of five stars.  These stars will indicate at a glance whether a program meets important quality standards.  The stars are not filled in yet because the rating system is still under development at the state level.  (At this time, empty stars do not mean that a program did not or will not receive any stars.)</p>

    <h2 class="question">I don’t have a computer at home.  Do I have to go on the internet to use the Early Learning Portal?</h2>

    <p>No!  All of the information found in the Early Learning Portal can be sent directly to your phone by text message.  Simply call or text your 5-digit ZIP code to (773) 886-1819 and follow the prompts.  You will then receive the information you need by text message.  You do not need to use a smartphone for this service.  Standard messaging rates apply.</p>

    <h2 class="question">I am not sure what programs fit my family’s needs.  Is there someone I can call?</h2>

    <p>There are several local organizations that can help you think about your options for early childhood education.  In some cases, they may be able to help you figure out if you qualify for childcare assistance payments (CCAP) and how to sign up.</p>

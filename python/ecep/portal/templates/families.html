        <p>Early learning programs and experiences activate your child while they are at the most important stage of developing the abilities that will become the foundation for success in school and beyond. Early learning activities are designed to support the development of physical, intellectual and social and emotional skills.

        <p>Children that are exposed to early learning activities are not only better prepared to enter kindergarten, but they have greater success in graduating high school, raising their future earning and career potential, and achieving their adult goals.</p>

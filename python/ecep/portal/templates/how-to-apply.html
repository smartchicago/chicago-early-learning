        <h2 class="enroll-subheader">Apply</h2>
        <p>This year, Chicago launched an online application to apply for preschool programs at over 600 sites throughout the city accessible from your home computer, shared computer or mobile phone. Visit <a href="https://s56.esserver.com/cel035.enginuity.web.v6">the online application site</a> to sign up for family account and profile, create an application for your child(ren), and select your preferred sites. You will be able to immediately see if you are eligible for a preliminary placement with a provider.</p>

        <p>If you do not have access to a computer or mobile phone or would prefer in person assistance, visit one of 10 Family Resource Centers throughout the city, where a Family Resource Specialist can assist you. A list of Family Resource Centers is available <a href="{% url 'faq' %}#list-of-family-resource-centers">here</a>.</p>

        <p>You can also call the Chicago Early Learning Hotline at <a href="tel:3122291690">(312) 229-1690</a> and submit an application over the phone.</p>

        <p>If you are interested in programs for children birth to aged three – contact your preferred provider directly.</p>
        <hr>

        <h2 class="enroll-subheader">Visit to confirm</h2>
        <p>Once you have received a preliminary placement, you will be directed to your provider or a Family Resource Center to provide additional information that may confirm your placement. We recommend that you call your site in advance to confirm the necessary materials and a good time to visit.</p>

        <p>Once your placement is confirmed, you will receive any additional info necessary to finish registration and start the program. Please let your provider know if you need an immediate placement, or you are interested in enrolling for the next program year. Both options may be available.</p>

        <p>If your child or family is in a temporary living situation, living in a shelter, or sharing a house with another family, you will not be required to provide documentation. Falsifying this information may result in loss of placement.</p>

        <p>If you are looking to enroll your child in a birth to three year old program or home visiting services, please contact your preferred sites directly or call the Hotline for assistance.</p>

Children who will be turning 3 or 4 by September 1st of the current school year are eligible to apply for preschool at a Chicago Public Schools (CPS) preschool or community-based site. Children who are 5 years old by September 1st of the current school year should enroll in kindergarten at a CPS preschool. Some children with Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) and some children who seek to enroll in the middle of a program year may also be considered preschool-eligible depending on the provider and the child’s needs.

              <p>{% blocktrans %}A Chicago Public Schools preschool site is affiliated with an elementary school run through CPS. A community-based site may be locally owned and operated. At this time, admission to a CPS preschool does not necessarily guarantee admission to kindergarten at that location. Hours may be longer than a traditional school day at a community-based site, often up to 10 hours, but they will vary location by location. Most community-based settings have services for younger children, ages 0 – 3 years old.  The Verify and Enroll steps of the preschool application process are a little bit different for a CPS school.

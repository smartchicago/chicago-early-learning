            <h1>What programs are available for my child?</h1>
            <p>Different programs serve children of different ages and are funded in a variety of ways. Many sites have more than one type of program. The descriptions below will help you understand the general differences between programs.</p>
            <p>While early childhood education is important for the healthy development of every child, each family has different needs. It is important to select a program that fits your family's budget and schedule, and one that provides a safe and stimulating environment for your child. You should call and visit each program that you are interested in to find out more about whether it is a good fit for your family, whether your child meets eligibility requirements, and how to apply.</p>
            <h2>Head Start</h2>
            <p>This program provides educational and early childhood development activities that promote school readiness for three to five year old children from low-income families. It includes free medical, dental, and mental health services and nutritious meals, as well as parent education and training. Head Start programs can be Half Day or Full Day:</p>
            <p><strong>Head Start Half Day</strong> - This program uses only Head Start funds to provide a comprehensive child development program for children who attend mornings or afternoon sessions for a 10-month period, Monday through Friday, September through June.</p>
            <p><strong>Head Start Full Day</strong> - This program is a comprehensive child development program for children who attend programs for a full school day, receiving services from 9:00 a.m. – 2:30 p.m.</p>
            <h2>Early Head Start</h2>
            <p>This program provides educational and early childhood development activities for children from birth to three years old from low-income families. It includes free medical, dental, and mental health services and nutritious meals, as well as parent education and training.</p>
            <h2>Preschool for All and Prevention Initiative</h2>
            <p>Chicago Public Schools aims to offer families quality early childhood choices for your child. Preschool for All offers a program that is in session for a minimum of two hours and thirty-five minutes a day, five days a week for children between the ages of three and five. Some programs are offered in elementary schools, while others are offered in community organizations that have partnered with Chicago Public Schools.</p>
            <p>The Prevention Initiative offers both center-based care for children birth to age three and home visiting services for families, depending on the site.</p>
            <p>Both Preschool for All and Prevention Initiative programs are designed to provide your child with meaningful early childhood experiences to help them get ready for kindergarten. Both programs give priority to families based on income and eligibility for free and reduced lunch.</p>
            <h2>Tuition-Based</h2>
            <p>Tuition-Based Preschools offer parents school-based tuition-based option for children ages three and four. A limited number of CPS elementary schools offer this option, which might include part-day or full-school-day programming. All participating families are required to pay tuition along with a non-refundable deposit at time of registration. Parents also sign a one-year program agreement.</p>
            <h2>Child-Parent Centers</h2>
            <p>The Chicago Public Schools’ Child-Parent Centers provide services to preschool (ages three to four) children and their parents in targeted areas across the city. Programs enroll the majority of their children at age three and provide two continuous years of service before kindergarten. The programs provide comprehensive educational services for children and opportunities for parents to get involved.</p>
            <p>It is common for multiple programs to be offered at the same location. In some cases, program models are combined to extend the hours of service provided (e.g., combining Head Start with Child Care).</p>
            <h2>Child Care Assistance Program</h2>
            <p>The Child Care Assistance Program provides working families with access to quality, affordable child care (based in income) while they work. Families cost-share on a sliding scale based on family size and income level. At many locations, funded early childhood education programs such as Head Start and Preschool for All partner with programs to offer added and enhanced program options.</p>
            <p>Parents may access child care assistance in two ways. Many child care centers accept applications on site for their own services and collaboration programs. Other centers use the certificate program administered by Illinois Action for Children. This program helps eligible families pay for any legal form of care whether licensed or license-exempt, and for children of all ages. Illinois Action for Children can be reached at 1-312-823-1100.</p>

            <h1>Will I have to pay anything to enroll my child?</h1>
            <p>The best way to find out whether you will have to pay anything is to call the center or program and ask. Some locations receive funding from the government so that families who cannot afford to pay can still benefit from early learning programs. Other programs accept child care assistance payments (CCAP) or base the amount your family owes on your income. Many programs have a combination of funding sources. Because every family and program is different, it is very important to call the programs you are interested in to talk about payment options.</p>
